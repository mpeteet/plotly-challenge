I built an interactive dashbaord to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

Using the D3 library I read in a JSON file of samples from the study that was performed.  You are able to select a specific study participant and the following dashboard is rendered:

-- Display the sample metadata, i.e., an individual's demographic information

-- A Bar Chart of the top ten microbe types in that participant

-- A Bubble Chart of each microbe sample
